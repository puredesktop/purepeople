# purepeople

## What purepeople does

A contact book that brings together people and organizations from your work across the suite. Curate contact details, merge duplicates, maintain lists, and explore relationships while protecting explicit edits from automatic feed updates.

## App layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Navigation rail** | Switch between people and organizations, search records, and work through lists. |
| **Record list** | Choose the person or organization you want to inspect. |
| **Record details** | Edit addresses, roles, organizations, phone numbers, notes, tags, and links. |
| **Import and relationship views** | Bring in CSV records, review merges, and explore encounter and relationship context. |

The app also uses the shared [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) shell and drawer agent. Panels can vary with the current view and selection.

## Getting started

1. Add a contact or import contacts using the available import controls.
2. Review names, addresses, organizations, roles, phone numbers, notes, and tags.
3. Merge duplicates and correct fields directly. Explicit edits are protected from automatic feed updates, which fill missing information.

Read the [app guide](docs/app-guide.md) for development, loading, and source-layout details.

## Develop and customize

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. You can add features to purepeople, develop a fork, or create a new app for [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai).

### Use Claude Code, Codex, or your own tools

Open a local source checkout or a purefactory project's folder in your preferred coding tool. Ask it to read this README, `plugin.json`, `package.json`, `agents.md`, and the [development guide](docs/development.md) before making changes. Review the changes, run the app's checks, and test it inside [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). This source may require matching shared platform packages; a browser preview alone does not provide desktop services.

The [development guide](docs/development.md) explains how to start Claude Code or Codex in the project, work on this repository, and load your app into the desktop.

### Use purefactory inside the desktop

Open **purefactory** (Factory) to describe a new app, or select an available app project and request a feature. Use **Open folder** to continue with external tools and **Open app** to test the result. You can also request a local app change through the app's drawer where app-development integration is available; distinguish changing the app from editing its current document.

Use **Share** in purefactory to create a `.pureapp` package. In current builds, install it through **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…**. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#load-and-share-your-app) for the full workflow and version differences.

## Developer accounts and the marketplace

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Go to [puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai) and [create a developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers) to join the developer community and submit your app for review.

Bring improvements to this app, develop a fork, or build something entirely new. We welcome **open-source and proprietary projects alike** to the [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) marketplace. Support for **paid apps is coming soon**, so you will be able to charge for your apps if you choose. Forks and redistributed dependencies must follow their applicable licenses.

For developer access, app submissions, or marketplace questions, contact [info@puredesktop.ai](mailto:info@puredesktop.ai).
